# Maze
This is a program, that can solve mazes using different algorithms. Currenly it supports BFS (Breadth first search), DFS (Depth firts search), and (kind of) quantum search (watch this: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SCDQbju-D8o). Input your maze (with 2 as the goal, 1 the path, and 0 the walls), enter your entry point, and watch the magic happen!
